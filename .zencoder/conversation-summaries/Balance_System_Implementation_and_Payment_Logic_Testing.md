## Complete Conversation Summary
The conversation focused on implementing a comprehensive balance management system for a Telegram bot that handles top-up transactions and product purchases. The user's API balance was depleted, so we needed to create tests to verify the implemented logic without making external API calls.

**Initial Problem Identification:**
The main issues identified were:
1. User balance was not being deducted after successful transactions across all payment methods
2. WhatsApp notifications were sent at incorrect times (after transaction completion instead of when admin approval was needed for top-ups)
3. Missing error notifications to admin and WhatsApp for system failures
4. No balance validation before allowing purchases

**Key Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Balance Management Functions:**
   - Added `DeductUserBalance()` function to subtract balance after successful purchases
   - Added `AddUserBalance()` function for top-up confirmations and testing
   - Modified `ConfirmTopUp()` to use the new AddUserBalance function for consistency

2. **Payment Flow Improvements:**
   - Updated `handlePayment()` to validate user balance before processing any purchase
   - Added insufficient balance error handling with clear messaging showing required top-up amount
   - Modified `handleDirectPayment()` to deduct balance for all payment methods (BALANCE, QRIS, Deeplink)
   - Updated success messages to show remaining balance after purchase

3. **Notification System Enhancements:**
   - Fixed WhatsApp notification timing for top-up requests (now sent when user creates request, not after confirmation)
   - Added WhatsApp notifications for all transaction types: successful purchases, QRIS payments, deeplink payments
   - Enhanced `notifyAdminError()` to also send WhatsApp notifications for system errors
   - Added WhatsApp notifications for top-up confirmations and rejections

4. **Testing Implementation:**
   - Created `test_balance.go` to verify balance operations without API calls
   - Created `test_payment_logic.go` to test purchase scenarios with different balance levels
   - Both tests successfully demonstrated that the balance system works correctly

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/korteks/Documents/project/bottele/service/topup_service.go` - Added balance management functions
- `/home/korteks/Documents/project/bottele/internal/bot/handler.go` - Updated payment flows, notifications, and balance validation
- Created test files to verify functionality

**Technical Approach:**
The implementation ensures that all payment methods (BALANCE, QRIS, Deeplink) now require sufficient user balance before processing. The system validates balance upfront, processes the external payment if needed, then deducts the user's internal balance upon success. This creates a unified balance system regardless of the external payment method used.

**Test Results:**
Both test files executed successfully, demonstrating:
- Balance creation, addition, and deduction work correctly
- Insufficient balance scenarios are properly handled
- Multiple transaction scenarios work as expected
- The system prevents purchases when balance is insufficient
- Balance validation logic functions properly

**Current Status:**
The balance system is fully implemented and tested. All payment methods now properly deduct user balance, comprehensive WhatsApp notifications are in place, and the system includes proper error handling. The implementation is ready for production use without requiring external API calls for testing.
