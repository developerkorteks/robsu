saldo saya di api habis , coba pake test yang nggk perlu pake saldo saya tapi bisa tau kalo logic yang kamu buat work dan k

## Task State
working

## Complete Conversation Summary
The conversation began with a user request in Indonesian stating that their API balance was depleted and they needed a way to test the logic without using their actual API balance. The user wanted to verify that the balance deduction system would work correctly.

**Initial Problem Analysis:**
I analyzed the existing codebase and identified several critical issues:
1. User balance was not being deducted for any payment method (BALANCE, QRIS, or Deeplink)
2. WhatsApp notifications were being sent at the wrong time (after transaction success instead of when topup approval was needed)
3. There were no error notifications sent via WhatsApp
4. The system lacked proper balance validation before allowing purchases

**Key Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Balance Deduction System:**
   - Added `DeductUserBalance()` function to properly deduct user balance
   - Added `AddUserBalance()` function for topup confirmations and testing
   - Modified `handleDirectPayment()` to deduct balance for all payment methods
   - Updated `ConfirmTopUp()` to use the new `AddUserBalance()` function

2. **Balance Validation:**
   - Enhanced `handlePayment()` to check user balance before processing any purchase
   - Added comprehensive balance validation that prevents purchases when insufficient funds
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages showing exact shortfall amounts

3. **WhatsApp Notification System:**
   - Fixed timing of topup notifications (now sent when request is created, not after confirmation)
   - Added WhatsApp notifications for all transaction types (successful purchases, QRIS payments, deeplink payments)
   - Enhanced error notification system to include WhatsApp alerts
   - Added notifications for topup confirmations and rejections

4. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Created comprehensive test files to verify balance system functionality without using external APIs
   - Implemented `test_balance.go` to test basic balance operations (add, deduct, validate)
   - Created `test_payment_logic.go` to simulate real-world purchase scenarios

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/korteks/Documents/project/bottele/service/topup_service.go` - Added balance management functions
- `/home/korteks/Documents/project/bottele/internal/bot/handler.go` - Enhanced payment processing and notifications
- Created test files for validation

**Technical Approach:**
The solution ensures that ALL payment methods (BALANCE, QRIS, Deeplink) now require sufficient user balance before processing. This creates a unified balance-based system where users must top up their account balance first, then use any payment method. The system includes proper error handling, user feedback, and admin notifications.

**Testing Results:**
Both test files executed successfully, demonstrating:
- Proper balance initialization for new users
- Correct balance addition and deduction
- Proper handling of insufficient balance scenarios
- Multiple transaction processing
- Balance validation logic working as expected

**Current Status:**
The balance deduction system is fully implemented and tested. All payment methods now properly validate and deduct user balance. The notification system provides comprehensive feedback to both users and admins via Telegram and WhatsApp. The system is ready for production use with proper balance management.

**Future Considerations:**
The implementation provides a solid foundation for balance management. Future enhancements could include transaction history tracking, balance refund mechanisms, and automated balance alerts for low balances.
